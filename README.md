## Welcome to Anti-bullying Initiative

### "My PhD broke me"—bullying in academia and a call to action
Workplace bullying strongly contributes to attrition and the mental health crisis in academia, and while some funding agencies have recently begun to acknowledge its effects and take action, there is very little support that victims receive. The most vulnerable among victims of bullying are trainees (graduate students, postdocs), research associates, untenured professors, and minority groups. This can result in reduced diversity and negatively impact the academic ecosystem in the long term. 

Results from our recent international bullying survey shows that most respondents do not know how to report bullying at their university or institution. We would like this to change, and are driven and motivated to build an online resource, where individuals who have experienced bullying can anonymously share their experiences and access resources that would support them through their difficult situation. We envision this to be a mutual support-driven platform for early career researchers by early career researchers.

We believe it’s time to have open conversations about bullying in academia, and that this will lead us towards a systemic change in the long term. In the meantime, we would like to focus on those that are struggling under current practices, and we would need support to do that.  

### The project 

Over the past year, as part of the anti-bullying initiative in the eLife ambassador programme, we have discussed building an online platform-- ‘The Invisible Wall’ for individuals who have experienced bullying and harassment in academia. This platform would serve to enable scientists to post their stories and seek support from a group of volunteers. They will be referred to available resources in the countries they are based in, and be actively encouraged to seek professional help in dire cases. 
A few of our ideas are listed below:
- We would like the platform to assure complete anonymity unless otherwise specified . 
- We would need moderators of diverse intersectional backgrounds. 
- We envision having a survey at the start, with examples of bullying. 
- We would like to have a ‘Wall’ where people can post their stories. The responses can either be public or private, but all responses will be moderated before appearing on the wall. The stories can resemble post-it notes, symbolising their importance, yet emphasising that they will not be held there permanently. 
- The resource page on the platform, which will carry links to local support would be updated regularly.
